# Hi there, I'm Ángel Beamud 👋

### Software Engineer | Backend & Cloud Architecture

I am a Software Engineer with over 5 years of experience in the tech industry. My career is focused on building robust backend systems, transitioning from application development to **System Architecture** and **Engineering Leadership**.

I prioritize **Clean Architecture**, **Scalability**, and **Best Practices** over hype cycles.

---

### 🎯 Engineering Philosophy

I treat frameworks and languages just as tools to solve business problems. My value lies in:

* **Reliability:** Designing systems that handle errors gracefully and maintain data integrity (ACID).
* **Scalability:** Understanding how to move from monolithic applications to distributed systems when needed.
* **Maintainability:** Applying patterns like **Hexagonal Architecture** and **DDD** to keep codebases healthy long-term.

---

### 🛠️ Technical Stack

I focus on mastering the ecosystem for modern backend services:

* **Core:** TypeScript, Node.js, NestJS.
* **Background:** Java Ecosystem (Spring Boot).
* **Data:** SQL (PostgreSQL), NoSQL strategies, and Caching (Redis).
* **Infrastructure:** Docker, Containerization, and CI/CD principles.

---

### 🚀 Continuous Learning

My personal R&D focuses on bridging the gap between software development and operations:

* Deepening knowledge in **System Design** and High Concurrency.
* Exploring **Cloud-Native** patterns and Infrastructure as Code.
* Studying **Distributed Systems** concepts (Consistency, Availability, Partitioning).

> *Note: Most of my professional work happens in private corporate repositories. This profile serves as a summary of my technical background and professional interests.*
